# Solstafir Next.js Project

This repository contains [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). dedicated to my favorite band, Solstafir. The purpose of this project is to enhance my understanding of Next.js from building to deployment, while also paying homage to the band I idolize.

This Next.js project as a showcase for me in creating dynamic elements where I use the .map() method to take a value from the data.js file and it will be displayed according to the index of the value in it so that we can add values/data easily, just need to do it in in the data.js file so it will be very easy to develop this project in the future.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
